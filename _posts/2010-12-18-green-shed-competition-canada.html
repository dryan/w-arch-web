<p><span style="color: #009900;">GREEN SHED:</span> An open, international competition for small scale, sustainable design.<br />In dense urban settings, community gardens are an invaluable public resource - they not only provide the opportunity for city dwellers to grow their own food, but they may also educate the wider community about organics, food security, and sustainability.</p>

<p>Our project teamâ€™s design for the Green Shed incorporates by-products from park and garden maintenance, rain water and snow melt capture and sun storage to create a self-sustaining structure for year-around use. The shed captures heat from biodegrading organic materials in the wall and floor cavities. The building frame and infill components are made from locally sourced lumber and reclaimed corrugated glass and metal panels.</span></div><div align="justify">
