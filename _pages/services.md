WA has worked in some of the most iconic buildings in the city of Chicago, including the Rockefeller Chapel, and Willis Tower.  WA provides full architectural services to municipalities, institutions, commercial and residential clients. We take a holistic approach to the design and construction of the built environment in that all aspects of a job (scope, design intent, budget and schedule) must be considered during all phases of a project. Solutions are generated to meet the clientsâ€™ needs; these may be design solutions or a creative construction approach along with a rigorous QA/QC program.
