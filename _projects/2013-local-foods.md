  Local Foods is Chicagoâ€™s first wholesale distributor and retailer of strictly local foods from Midwestern farms. The new 18,000 SF Willow Street facility includes 12,000 SF of back-of-house dry and cold storage, wholesale distribution, and food processing areas, as well as a market, cafe, butcher shop, and training center open to the public. WA was brought onto the project to provide permitting and construction administration assistance, design-build construction detailing, coordination of equipment, exterior facade and interior design consultation, and millwork design.
