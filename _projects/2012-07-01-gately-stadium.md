  Gately Stadium is located on the South Side of Chicago. It has rich history hosting high school football games for some of the most prominent teams in the city. Aside from high school football, Gately has been home to a diverse range of sports and was notably part of the venue for the 1959 Pan Am Games.  Waechter Architects was the Architect of Record for the total renovation which began in June of 2011. The renovation includes a new field, press box, coachâ€™s box, grandstand renovation/ restoration, building restoration, and window replacement.

photos: # I exported images at 2000x1500 in my shitty software. They don't look as crisp or dark as your originals. I tried to rename them things that made writing alt text easy, and helps search engines guess what the content is. If all your stuff has gately all over it, names and image names and alt text and etc., you will show up for this kinda thing.
